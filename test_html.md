# Welcome

This is the online home of _Geocomputation with R_, a book on geographic data analysis, visualization and modeling.

Note: **The first edition** of the book has been published by ***CRC Press*** in the [R Series](https://www.routledge.com/Chapman--HallCRC-The-R-Series/book-series/CRCTHERSER). You can buy the book from [CRC Press](https://www.routledge.com/9781138304512), or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Geocomputation-R-Robin-Lovelace-dp-0367670577/dp/0367670577/), and see the archived First Edition hosted on [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/geocompr/).

Inspired by the <u>Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial</u> ([FOSS4G](https://foss4g.org/)) movement, the code and prose underlying this book are open, ensuring that the content is reproducible, transparent, and accessible. Hosting the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr) allows anyone to interact with the project by opening issues or contributing new content and typo fixes for the benefit of everyone.

# How to contribute?

bookdown makes editing a book as easy as editing a wiki, provided you have a GitHub account ([sign-up at github.com](https://github.com/join)). Once logged-in to GitHub, click on the ‘Edit this page’ icon in the right panel of the book website. This will take you to an editable version of the the source [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) file that generated the page you’re on.

To raise an issue about the book’s content (e.g. code not running) or make a feature request, check-out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr/issues).

Maintainers and contributors must follow this repository’s [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Reproducibility

The quickest way to reproduce the contents of the book if you’re new to geographic data in R may be in the web browser, thanks to Binder. Clicking on the link below should open a new window containing RStudio Server in your web browser, enabling you to open chapter files and running code chunks to test that the code is reproducible.

If you see something like the image below, congratulations, it worked! You can start exploring Geocomputation with R in a cloud-based environment, noting [mybinder.org user guidelines](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/user-guidelines.html):

# Getting involved

If you find the project of use and interest, you can get involved in many ways, by:

- Telling people about it
- Buying a copy
- Helping people get started with open source software for reproducible research in general, and working with geographic data in R in particular (this can be an excellent way to consolidate and build your own skills)
- ‘Starring’ the geocompr GitHub repository
- Citing and linking-to it
- Communicating about the book online, via the #geocompr hashtag on Twitter (see our Guestbook at geocompx.org) or by letting us know of courses using the book
- Reviewing it, on Amazon, Goodreads or elsewhere
- Asking questions about the content or making suggestion on GitHub, Twitter or Discord
- Answering questions, or at least responding to people asking for clarification or reproducible examples to demonstrate their question
- Supporting community translations
  - The Spanish version: https://r.geocompx.org/es/
  - The French version: https://r.geocompx.org/fr/
  - The Japanese version: http://babayoshihiko.ddns.net/geo/
